1. You can add any product available for sale at any of your configured merchants. In this example we would be adding the Amazon Echo, using the Amazon ASIN 'B01GAGVC9K'. Interesting information about the product is automatically pulled in for you to double check. You can then add in a short link that your site visitors will see, and some text for site visitors to click on. Short, helpful suggestions are provided to get you started, but you are free to choose anything you like. When done, click 'Create'.
2. With your product added, a snippet of code is created which you can 'copy to clipboard', and then paste into your blog posts as needed. You don't need to know anything about HTML, code, or programming to use this plugin. Just copy / paste, and away you go.
3. When you paste in the snippet of code to any blog post, you will see the current price automatically appear before your eyes. Whenever the price updates at any time in the future, your blog post will now always display the correct, current price.
